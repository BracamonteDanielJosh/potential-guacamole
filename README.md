**Project Title**
Frontend
**Description**
This project implements a simple Ethereum smart contract for managing an account on the blockchain. It allows users to deposit and withdraw funds from the account securely. The smart contract keeps track of account balances, deposits, and withdrawals using Solidity programming language.

**Getting Started**

**Installing**
- Download or clone the Solidity code file (`Frontend.sol`) from this repository.

**Executing program**
- To deploy the contract, you need an Ethereum development environment like Remix or Truffle.
- Compile the contract in your chosen environment.
- Deploy the compiled contract to an Ethereum network (e.g., Ganache, Ropsten, etc.).
- Interact with the deployed contract using a web3 provider or directly from a client like Remix IDE.

**Help**
- Ensure you have a basic understanding of Ethereum and Solidity programming.
- Refer to the Solidity documentation for any language-related queries.
- If facing issues with deployment or interaction, double-check the network configuration and contract addresses.
